# Image Manipulation and Enhancement

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced image manipulation techniques using Python. It covers a range of operations including rotation, cropping, resizing, color space conversion, histogram analysis, and image filtering. The aim is to enhance and transform images through various processing techniques and visualize the results.

## Objectives
- Apply image transformations: rotation, cropping, and resizing.
- Convert images between RGB, HSV, and grayscale color spaces.
- Perform histogram analysis and equalization to enhance contrast.
- Apply various filters (Gaussian Blur, Median Filter, Sharpening) to improve image quality.
- Combine techniques to process and compare images.

## Libraries Used
- **OpenCV**: Image manipulation and color space conversion.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting histograms and comparisons.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced plotting.
- **Pandas**: Data handling.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.

## Visualizations
- **Scatter Plots**: Pixel intensity relationships before and after transformations.
- **Pair Plots**: Relationships between image channels (R, G, B).
- **Box Plots**: Distribution of pixel values before and after histogram equalization.
- **Histograms**: For original, transformed, and filtered images.
- **Filtered Image Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of original and filtered images.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of advanced image manipulation techniques, showcasing the application of various methods to enhance and transform images. The visualizations and analyses demonstrate the impact of each technique and aid in understanding their effectiveness.
